
L1Q1: Write a Python program to implement a simple calculator. The output should be something like ( Make use for string method formatting)Virtual programming lab
Select operation. 

1.Add 

2.Subtract 

3.Multiply 

4.Divide

 Enter choice(1/2/3/4): 3

 Enter first number: 15 

Enter second number: 14 

15 * 14 = 210

L2Q2: Write a Python program to check if a year is leap.Virtual programming lab
A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. For example,

2017 is not a leap year 

1900 is a not leap year 

2012 is a leap year 

2000 is a leap year.
